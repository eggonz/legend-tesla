	<h2>Origin</h2>
	<p>This project was originally intended to be a simple but varied little game, as the final project for a programming course. Its development started in November 2019, and will continue to grow in the near future.</p>

	<h2>References</h2>
	<p>This game is based on several already famous RPG and Action-Adventure game titles.</p>
	<p>
		<ul>
			<li><a href="https://zelda.com/">The Legend of Zelda</a>
				<p>
				The main idea was originated from the series <strong>The Legend of Zelda</strong>, which inspired the overworld mechanics and items.
				</p>
			<li><a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/">Pokémon</a>
				<p>
				The second clear reference has been the <strong>Pokémon</strong> series, which helped most at implementing battle mechanics and layout.
				</p>
		</ul>
	</p>
	<p> In addition, <strong>Science</strong> is always present, providing a perfect topic for the main story. Many other games, films, series and music have inspired this game too, as well as its soundtracks.</p>

	<h2>Coding</h2>
	<p>This project is programmed in Java. Although at the time of starting making the game my knowledge of the programming language was quite good, at least for a recent begginer, I knew almost nothing about game programming. As I had to start from scratch, I got help from several online game-making tutorials, which contributed most to project organization and hierarchy.</p>

	<h2>Resources</h2>
	<p>The main ideas were directly taken from existing sources and projects principally. Nevertheless, for the creation and edition of some image and video resources, softwares such as <a href="https://krita.org/en/">Krita</a> and <a href="https://kdenlive.org/en/">Kdenlive</a> were very useful. In the future, more elaborated graphics and animations may be added or used instead.</p>
